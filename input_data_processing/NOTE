TEST1
 - Fixed a bug in node_labels 
 - Filter genes
 - Normalize
 - Scaling
 - Used TFs and required_genes only for both training and predicting
 - pseudobulking 150 cells
TEST2
 - Fixed a bug in node_labels 
 - Filter genes
 - Normalize
 - Scaling
 - Used TFs and all genes for both training and predicting
 - pseudobulking 150 cells
TEST3
 - Fixed a bug in node_labels 
 - Filter genes
 - Normalize
 - Scaling
 - Used TFs and all genes for both training and predicting
 * Use the same blacklist as eBIC - selected_genes <- intersect of genes in expression and network
 - pseudobulking 150 cells
TEST4
 - Fixed a bug in node_labels
 - Filter genes
 - Normalize
 - Scaling
 - Used TFs and all genes for both training and predicting
 - Use the same blacklist as eBIC - selected_genes <- intersect of genes in expression and network
 - randomly selected 150 single cells
 - early stopping
