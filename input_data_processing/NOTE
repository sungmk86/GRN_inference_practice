TEST1
 - Fixed a bug in node_labels 
 - Filter genes
 - Normalize
 - Scaling
 - Used TFs and required_genes only for both training and predicting
 - pseudobulking 150 cells
TEST2
 - Fixed a bug in node_labels 
 - Filter genes
 - Normalize
 - Scaling
 - Used TFs and all genes for both training and predicting
 - pseudobulking 150 cells
TEST3
 - Fixed a bug in node_labels 
 - Filter genes
 - Normalize
 - Scaling
 - Used TFs and all genes for both training and predicting
 * Use the same blacklist as eBIC - selected_genes <- intersect of genes in expression and network
 - pseudobulking 150 cells
 - for robustness test using 3 random seed(111, 123, 1234)
TEST4
 - Used JASPAR instead of STRING for training and predicting
 - Refactored scripts
 - Used TMM method for normalization
 - Made a change to the method for pseudobulking. Previously, the method randomly selected 150 cells out of a total of N cells, resulting in the exclusion of the remaining N-150 cells. Now we generate multiple replicates and use the median valude from the replicates.
TEST5
 - Used JASPAR for training and STRING for predicting
